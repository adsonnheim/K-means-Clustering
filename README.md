# K-means-Clustering
K-means Clustering algorithm from scratch in Python. Uses Numpy for a few mathematical functions, as well as Matplotlib for visualization. Additionally includes the testing of multiple k-values which can then be used with the elbow method to determine the most ideal k-value.

TO-DO: dynamically plot the ideal k-value on the elbow chart using derivatives, rather than manually.
